        <p>
            <strong>I</strong><br><strong>w</strong>ant to<br> <strong>b</strong>e your perfect<br><strong> s</strong>cent, your missed rent,<br><strong> t</strong>hose days you feel you<br><strong> n</strong>eed to repent. 
            I want you<br><strong>t</strong>o listen to these cheesy rhymes, feeding<br><strong> m</strong>e these sweet lines, be together all the<br><strong> t</strong>ime. 
            I want to be your dark brown hair,<br><strong> t</strong>he place back when we didn't care, the memories<br><strong> o</strong>nly we share. 

            I want you in all the ways<br><strong> I</strong> can say. 
            I'll want you forever and always each and<br><strong> e</strong>very day.
           
           
I never knew you could know me so much better<br><strong>
I ignored all the great weather 
the darkest cloud hung over me and<br> I let my head fall on the air
my hair was still wet but not the day that we<br> met

Was it someone like you who did it to be so kind
Leaves on the grass with<br> words drawn out
You admired me and wanted to hold my hand
I let the curtains fly<br> in
Didn’t want the wind to pass me by

Wearing the t-shirts with the cheesiest slogans
Dropping<br> love on my sleeve
Too many wishes that I hope they’re not an omen
            I never knew a heart could beat for me</strong>
